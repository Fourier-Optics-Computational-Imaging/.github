## Software

### [Zodiax](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/zodiax): Object-Oriented Jax

`Zodiax` is a lightweight extension to the object-oriented `jax` package `equinox`, designed to to simplify working with pytrees for scientific data analysis, adding extra functionality to make working with optimisation and inference libraries like optax and NumPyro easy.

### [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux): Optical models parametrised neural-networks

`dLux` is a differentiable physical optics modelling framework built using `jax` for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

Please add links to the software and repos you are working on here!

## Projects

### TOLIMAN

The TOLIMAN space telescope is an affordable and agile mission focused on finding nearby exoplanets, with a particular interest in the Alpha Cen system. Contemporary astronomy struggles to identify rocky planets in specific star systems, and TOLIMAN aims to solve this problem by pioneering high-precision astrometric monitoring to study stars within 10 parsecs of the sun.

### JWST

## The Bull meeting method

- Everyone creates a single slide with a title and a short description of what they are working on
- Everyone presents their slide for 1 minute
- Everyone makes bids some amount of time to present either their own work or the work of others
- We then take turns presenting in order of least to most amount of time bid
  - These 'presentations' are not meant to be formal, but rather a chance to discuss the work of others
  - Feel free to interrupt, ask questions and discuss!
