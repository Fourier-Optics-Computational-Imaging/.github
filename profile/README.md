## Software:

### [Zodiax](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/zodiax): Object-Oriented Jax

`Zodiax` is a lightweight extension to the object-oriented `jax` package `equinox`, designed to to simplify working with pytrees for scientific data analysis, adding extra functionality to make working with optimisation and inference libraries like optax and NumPyro easy.


### [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux): Optical models parametrised neural-networks

`dLux` is a differentiable physical optics modelling framework built using `jax` for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

## Projects

### TOLIMAN

The TOLIMAN space telescope is an affordable and agile mission focused on finding nearby exoplanets, with a particular interest in the Alpha Cen system. Contemporary astronomy struggles to identify rocky planets in specific star systems, and TOLIMAN aims to solve this problem by pioneering high-precision astrometric monitoring to study stars within 10 parsecs of the sun.

### JWST
